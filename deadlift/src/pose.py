    The gateway returns one flat list of person records, each tagged with the
    `frame_id` it came from, beside a `frames` list naming every frame it
    sampled. Everything downstream of here thinks in frames, so the records are
    grouped back into `{"index": ..., "persons": [...]}` once, here, rather than
    at every call site.

    `frames` is the authority on which frames exist, not the records: nobody is
    detected in some of them, those carry no records at all, and rebuilding the
    clip from the records alone would silently close the gap instead of showing
    it.

    `by_index` starts out holding each frame's own `persons` list, but that is
    only true until something filters them: every cleaning pass here rebinds
    `frame["persons"]` rather than editing the list in place, so a caller that
    cleans must rebuild `by_index` afterwards, as `main.py` does.

    The joint order is checked rather than assumed. `kpts_labels` names the
    joints the model actually returned, and every index in `skeleton.py` — which
    wrist, which ankle — is a position in that list. A model that returned a
    different layout would still draw, silently, as a tangle of limbs.
